## On all host run

* Disable selinux
* Disable IPv6
* Set to 1 swappines
* Disable transpsarent_hugepage
* Disables chronyd
* Install and enable NTPD

## Example Script to run 
```
sed -i "s/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/g" /etc/selinux/config
echo vm.swappiness=1 >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo "net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo "net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf

echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled	
echo 'echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag' >> /etc/rc.local
echo 'echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled' >> /etc/rc.local

#swappines to 1

systemctl stop chronyd.service
systemctl disable chronyd.service
yum -y install ntp
systemctl start ntpd
systemctl enable ntpd

```

## Prepare DB Mysql

Follow https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-private-cloud-base/7.1.3/installation/topics/cm_ig_mysql.html

Move contets MySQL

```
mv /var/lib/mysql/* mysql/
```

Configure my.cnf

```
[mysqld]
datadir=/var/lib/mysql
socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

# Disabling symbolic-links is recommended to prevent assorted security risks;
# to do so, uncomment this line:
symbolic-links = 0

key_buffer_size = 32M
max_allowed_packet = 16M
thread_stack = 256K
thread_cache_size = 64
query_cache_limit = 8M
query_cache_size = 64M
query_cache_type = 1

max_connections = 550
#expire_logs_days = 10
#max_binlog_size = 100M

#log_bin should be on a disk with enough free space.
#Replace '/var/lib/mysql/mysql_binary_log' with an appropriate path for your
#system and chown the specified folder to the mysql user.
log_bin=/var/lib/mysql/mysql_binary_log

#In later versions of MySQL, if you enable the binary log and do not set
#a server_id, MySQL will not start. The server_id must be unique within
#the replicating group.
server_id=1

```

```
sudo systemctl enable mysqld
sudo systemctl start mysqld
```

## Run mysql_secure_installation

```
mysql_secure_installation



NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MySQL
      SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!

In order to log into MySQL to secure it, we'll need the current
password for the root user.  If you've just installed MySQL, and
you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,
so you should just press enter here.


Enter current password for root (enter for none):
OK, successfully used password, moving on...

Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MySQL
root user without the proper authorisation.

Set root password? [Y/n] Y
New password:
Re-enter new password:
Password updated successfully!
Reloading privilege tables..
 ... Success!


By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
to log into MySQL without having to have a user account created for
them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
production environment.

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
 ... Success!

Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y
 ... Success!

By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
before moving into a production environment.

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y
 - Dropping test database...
ERROR 1008 (HY000) at line 1: Can't drop database 'test'; database doesn't exist
 ... Failed!  Not critical, keep moving...
 - Removing privileges on test database...
 ... Success!

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y
 ... Success!




All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MySQL
installation should now be secure.

Thanks for using MySQL!


Cleaning up...
